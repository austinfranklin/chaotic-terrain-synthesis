# chaotic-terrain-synthesis
A library for applying chaotic systems to wave terrain synthesis

- Chaotic system reference site: http://www.3d-meier.de/tut19/Seite0.html

We need:
- List of systems we want to include (not so important at this stage... will also require testing)
- List of visual effects and tools we would like to include.
- Efficient system for packaging library together... is each system its own object, for example? Do we want 50 objects?
- Standardization for each object (gen, obviously, but codebox or Max objects?)
- That's all I can think of for now
